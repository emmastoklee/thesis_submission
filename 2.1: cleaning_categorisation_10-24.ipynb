       "'As the transfer window opens, Harry Redknapp will be staring at his phone hoping it does not ring. With his Tottenham side seeing in the New Year in the fourth Champions League place, the renowned wheeler-dealer said he is relieved that he has no desperate need to sign players, describing the mid-season transfer window as \"a nightmare\". Lauding his squad as \"terrific\" the Tottenham manager said he is confident with the cover he has in every position. This is despite Jonathan Woodgate\\'s continuing absence with a groin strain and the ankle injury sustained by Benoît Assou-Ekotto against West Ham United, which has resulted in the full-back withdrawing from Cameroon\\'s African Cup of Nations squad and may rule him out until February. Last January Redknapp invested more than £40m in his side but he said he was much happier doing no business mid-season unless it is necessary: \"Oh, it\\'s a nightmare,\" he said. \"When you are at a struggling club you have got to do something to solve the problem. You have to take gambles because you are bottom of the league.\" Redknapp, who has signed 19 players in the last five January transfer windows, continued: \"Last time I took gambles. I brought [Jermain] Defoe back and [Robbie] Keane came back. I brought [Wilson] Palacios in and they turned us round. I brought better players in because that\\'s what I had to do.\" Reflecting on his return to Portsmouth in 2006, when he brought in five players mid-season, he said: \"We were desperate. They had the worst team I have ever seen in the Premier League and I had to bring in five or six players. We rounded a few up from here, there and everywhere and we managed to stay up.\" That season Portsmouth finished 17th, four points clear of the relegation zone and last term Redknapp guided Tottenham to eighth, after taking over from Juande Ramos with the side in 20th having taken just two points from eight games. However, this month, with his rejuvenated squad sitting fourth, two points ahead of Manchester City (albeit having played a game more) Redknapp said it was highly unlikely he would be wielding the chairman Daniel Levy\\'s chequebook. \"At the moment I haven\\'t got one player here that I am thinking of bringing in. Not one player,\" he said ahead of the FA Cup third-round tie withChampionship side Peterborough United. \"I may [sign someone]. You lot might all come back to me in two or three weeks and say, \\'I thought you weren\\'t going to buy any\\'. It may change. But the chances are very, very, very, very slim that I will bring anybody in here. Very slim. \"We are fourth and I have a terrific squad, I don\\'t know if we will finish in the top four but I don\\'t know where I will get players any better than I already have,\" he added. If Redknapp were to enter the market he has been told by Levy that any purchases must be paid for by the sale of existing squad members. One possible source of funding is Roman Pavyluchenko, after the disgruntled Russia international once again went public with his grievances. However, Redknapp vehemently denies accusations that he had \"mocked\" the 28-year-old by telling him he would start against Manchester United in the Carling Cup before leaving him on the bench for the whole 90 minutes of the 2-0 defeat at the beginning of last month. \"Mocked is such a silly word to use, I don\\'t understand what you\\'re talking about,\" Redknapp said. \"He said his head wasn\\'t right to play [after Russia had failed to qualify for the World Cup] – that was the problem with him. It\\'s hard to understand. \"The week before the Manchester United game he came to see me and said he didn\\'t really feel that he could play. I said I was going to play him tomorrow against Man U but he said, \\'I am not ready to play, my head is not right\\'.\"'"
